          <div>
            What is this site? --- I use AI a lot to help me with my studies and
            work. I also use it to help me write and think about things. ChatGPT
            has been really useful but still lacking in a lot of ways. So, I
            made this interface so that AI feels even more useful.
          </div>
          <div>
            {`How is this different from ChatGPT? ---
          1. This is a bit more opinionated towards the stuff that I've really enjoyed using ChatGPT for. 
          2. Also, you'll be able to access more AI models than just ChatGPT.
          3. We never store your local info. Our code is public so you can double check this yourself. We'll only pull info from your computer if you give us permission to do so.`}
          </div>
          <div>
            Can you tell me a bit more about how your data privacy works? ---
            Sure thing! We wrote it in more depth here, in simple everyday
            language.
          </div>
          <div>
            {`Why is this "Just an Experiment"? ---
          AI is improving so fast! So things here will also improve very quickly. `}
